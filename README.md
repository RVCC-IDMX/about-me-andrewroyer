## Color Scheme

I chose a light yellow bacckground with a dark color font to provide good contrast, I wanted a light color but I didn't want white because that could be overwhelming to the user. 


Colors Used
- ![#faf7c6](https://via.placeholder.com/15/faf7c6/faf7c6.png) `Background rgb(250, 247, 198) hex #faf7c6`
- ![#030240](https://via.placeholder.com/15/030240/030240.png) `Text  RGB (3,2,64) hex #030240`

## Nav Bar
Used the second method changed some settings so it was easier to see with my page color scheme.
