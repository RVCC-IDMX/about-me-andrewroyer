<!--Bio-->

<p> 
    I was born in New Jersey where I was raised by my mother.  I always had a connection to animals, especially cats.  Ever since I was born, we always have had at least one cat wherever I lived.    I also have enjoyed technology and video games.  I started playing driving games around three years old.  This has led to my interest in cars.</p>

    <p>I have faced a lot of challenges in my life but, have managed to overcome them.  I still face new challenges daily and often things that come easy to most people are a challenge.   I attended two different high schools before graduating and attending Raritan Valley Community College.  Normally I do well in Math, Science and technology classes.  The transition to college was made more difficult with COVID in addition to other issues I must deal with.  I am still determining my final major and what I want to do as a career.

<p> Image hover effects are a way to make your site more dynamic and visually interesting. They can allow you to present a larger number of images on a page by creating a gallery that allows the user to get a closer look without having to leave the page. Image hover effects also give you the opportunity to present other information about the image in a dynamic way by overlaying another image. </p>
<p> The images below represent a gallery where we want to preview the image and the user can hover over the image. The two main factors you can control are the delay before the hover effect takes place and it switches to the larger image and how large the image becomes. You need to take into account your use case for the timing. When deciding how large the image is you should make sure that when you hover over the image it wonâ€™t interfere with the other images on the page. There are other ways to alter the way the hover effect functions, but these are the main two parameters you should focus on. </p>
<p>First we create the gallery with the code below: </p>
<pre>
    <code>
    &lt;figure id="resizegallery"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Flowers&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt; 
    &lt;figure id="flower1"&gt; 
    &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Flower-flyOnFlower2.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 1"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Flower 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
    
    &lt;figure id="flower2"&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Lavender_field_in_bloom.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 2"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Flower 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
    
    &lt;figure id="flower3" &gt;
    &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Echinopsis_oxygona_flowers_bloom_02.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 3"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Flower 3&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>We need to make sure the gallery images are all the same size. We do this in the CSS file:  </p>
<pre> 
<code> 
    #resizegallery img {
        max-width: 250px;       
        }
</code>

</pre>
<p>Now we add the hover effect. this is also done in the CSS </p>
<pre> 
<code>
    #resizegallery img:hover {
    transform: scale(2);
    transition: .5s;
    transition-delay: 0.2s;
    }
</code>

</pre>
<p>We are setting three values for the resizing. The first one is the scale for the transform, two means the image doubles in size. Transition is how long it's going to take to grow to the larger size. If you don't supply this value it goes immediately after the transition is triggered. Transition-delay is how long the user has to hover over the image to trigger the transition. This is an optional value and if you don't supply it the effect happens as soon as you start hovering over the image.</p>
<figure id="resizegallery">
    <h2>Flowers</h2>
    <hr> 
    <figure id="flower1"> 
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Flower-flyOnFlower2.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 1">
    <figcaption>Flower 1</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure id="flower2">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Lavender_field_in_bloom.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 2">
    <figcaption>Flower 2</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure id="flower3" >
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Echinopsis_oxygona_flowers_bloom_02.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 3">
    <figcaption>Flower 3</figcaption>
    </figure>
</figure>

<p> Another way you can use hover effects to present more information is by using an overlay, the easiest way to do this is by having images or text that overlap each other and change the opacity. When the webpage is loaded the opacity will be set to zero and when the user hovers over the image the opacity will be set to one. This can be used in a case where you had a car dealership website when the user hovers over it can show the price of the car. </p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is put the image on the page and we are going to wrap in div tags and apply properties to those classes. </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Speedex_750_race_car.jpg" alt="Speedex 750 race car" class="image" style="width:100%;" &gt;
        &lt;div class="middle"&gt;
        &lt;div class="text"&gt;Speedex 750&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    </code>
</pre>
<p>This would show the image and the text would show up below the image. Now we are going to add the parts that will make it so you don't see the text when the page loads and when it shows up it will be on top on the image.</p>
<pre>
<code>
    .container {
        position: relative;
        width: 50%;
      }
      
      .image {
        opacity: 1;
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
        transition: .5s ease;
        backface-visibility: hidden;
      }
      
      .middle {
        transition: .5s ease;
        opacity: 0;
        position: absolute;
        top: 90%;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        text-align: center;
      }
      
      .container:hover .image {
        opacity: 0.9;
      }
      
      .container:hover .middle {
        opacity: 1;
      }
      
      .text {
        background-color: #000;
        color: white;
        font-size: 16px;
        padding: 16px 32px;
      }
</code>
</pre>
<p>The key elements are we set image opacity to one so it will show up. The .middle class is used for the text so we set it initally to zero so you can't see it. We also set some varibles such as top and left so we can control where it will show up when it appears. The .container:hover .image controls what happens to the image when it is hovered over, we set it to have an opacity of 0.9 so it will have a subtle effect and the user can still see the image. The .container:hover .middle is what we use to get the text to show up by setting the opacity to one. I played with the top value for the text and moved it closer to the bottom as it looked better that way. Try it for yourself by hovering over the image below.</p>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Speedex_750_race_car.jpg" alt="Speedex 750 race car" class="image" style="width:100%;" >
    <div class="middle">
    <div class="text">Speedex 750</div>
    </div>
