<!--Bio-->
<a id="bio"></a>
<p> 
    I was born in New Jersey where I was raised by my mother.  I always had a connection to animals, especially cats.  Ever since I was born, we always have had at least one cat wherever I lived.    I also have enjoyed technology and video games.  I started playing driving games around three years old.  This has led to my interest in cars.</p>

    <p>I have faced a lot of challenges in my life but, have managed to overcome them.  I still face new challenges daily and often things that come easy to most people are a challenge.   I attended two different high schools before graduating and attending Raritan Valley Community College.  Normally I do well in Math, Science and technology classes.  The transition to college was made more difficult with COVID in addition to other issues I must deal with.  I am still determining my final major and what I want to do as a career.

<p> Image hover effects are a way to make your site more dynamic and visually interesting. They can allow you to present a larger number of images on a page by creating a gallery that allows the user to get a closer look without having to leave the page. Image hover effects also give you the opportunity to present other information about the image in a dynamic way by overlaying another image. </p>

<p> The images below represent a gallery where we want to preview the image and the user can hover over the image. The two main factors you can control are the delay before the hover effect takes place and it switches to the larger image and how large the image becomes. You need to take into account your use case for the timing. When deciding how large the image is you should make sure that when you hover over the image it won’t interfere with the other images on the page. There are other ways to alter the way the hover effect functions, but these are the main two parameters you should focus on. </p>

<p>First we create the gallery with the code below </p>
<code>
    &lt;figure id="resizegallery"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Flowers&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt; 
    &lt;figure id="flower1"&gt; 
    &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Flower-flyOnFlower2.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 1"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Flower 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
    
    &lt;figure id="flower2"&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Flower_full_bloom.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 2"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Flower 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
    
    &lt;figure id="flower3" &gt;
    &lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Solanum_trilobatum_flowers.JPG" alt="Sample Flower 3"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Flower 3&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

</code>
<figure id="resizegallery">
    <h2>Flowers</h2>
    <hr> 
    <figure id="flower1"> 
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Flower-flyOnFlower2.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 1">
    <figcaption>Flower 1</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure id="flower2">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Flower_full_bloom.jpg" alt="Sample Flower 2">
    <figcaption>Flower 2</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <figure id="flower3" >
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Solanum_trilobatum_flowers.JPG" alt="Sample Flower 3">
    <figcaption>Flower 3</figcaption>
    </figure>
    

<p> Another way you can use hover effects to present more information is by using an overlay, the easiest way to do this is by having images that overlap each other and change the opacity. When the webpage is loaded the opacity will be set to zero and when the user hovers over the image the opacity will be set to one. This can be used in a case where you had a car dealership website when the user hovers over it can show the price of the car. </p>

<p> You can use hover effects to put a frame around an image. On touchscreen devices sometimes its hard to tell what you are selecting, by adding a frame you can illustrate what the user is selecting. The frame doesn’t take up much space so it’s useful on smaller screens. </p>
